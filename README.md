# 4yrAnniversary
A simple app I made for my 4 year anniversary gift for my girlfriend. It was codenamed 2b1s that way she wouldn't know what I was working on. Some features that this app uses that might be useful to look at are:
* UIDynamics
* Font Awesome
* Custom Segues
* Core Data
* Swifty format
* Tableviews 
* Page Control
* Tab Control
* CocoaPods
* Other

Feel free to tinker or use the code. :)
